# Fork CI

Two goals: **our changes don't break upstream**, and **upstream changes don't break our changes**. Upstream's checks are
reused untouched (so they improve with every upstream merge), and the fork only adds what upstream can't know about.

## What runs when

| Workflow                                                       | When                         | Checks                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ci.yml` (upstream, enabled, never edited)                     | Every PR, every release      | `deno fmt` / `deno lint` / `tsc` / `cargo fmt` / `clippy -D warnings` / `cargo test` over the **whole** repo, fork code included (it's compiled into the app). |
| [`fork-ci.yml`](../../.github/workflows/fork-ci.yml)           | Every PR, every release      | Fork rules + fork tests, below.                                                                                                                                |
| [`fork-release.yml`](../../.github/workflows/fork-release.yml) | Merge into `master`          | Runs both of the above, then builds ([releasing.md](releasing.md)).                                                                                            |
| [`fork-sync.yml`](../../.github/workflows/fork-sync.yml)       | 1st of every month / by hand | Opens a `sync/upstream-*` PR, on which both CIs run against the merged result.                                                                                 |

## Fork checks ([`fork/scripts/fork-check.ts`](../scripts/fork-check.ts))

| Check       | Fails when                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hooks`     | A hook listed in [FORK.md](../../FORK.md#hooks-into-upstream-files) is gone from its upstream file (first code span of the _Hook_ column, matched verbatim). Catches upstream merges dropping hooks. |
| `guard`     | A PR changes an upstream file listed neither under _Hooks into upstream files_ nor _Upstream patches_ in FORK.md. Enforces the fork rules and keeps FORK.md accurate. Skipped on sync PRs.           |
| `preflight` | Release only: public key missing or invalid, update endpoint not this repo.                                                                                                                          |
| `key-match` | Release only: the installer's signature isn't from the key installed copies trust.                                                                                                                   |

Run them locally with `node fork/scripts/fork-check.ts hooks` / `guard origin/master` (Node 22.18+).

## Fork tests

- **TypeScript**: `fork/**/*.test.ts`, Node's built-in runner (`node:test`, `node:assert`), no dependencies:
  `node --test "fork/**/*.test.ts"`. Put tests next to the code they test.
- **Rust**: `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` inside `fork/background/` files. They run in upstream's `cargo test` (the fork
  module is part of the main crate), or alone with `cargo test fork::`.

## Upstream sync

`fork-sync.yml` needs the **`FORK_SYNC_TOKEN`** secret: GitHub's default token can't push the upstream workflow changes
a merge usually brings, and PRs it opens don't trigger CI.

Create it at GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → **Fine-grained tokens**: repository access _only_
`winb1g/Seelen-UI-tweaks`; permissions **Contents**, **Pull requests** and **Workflows**: read and write. Save it as the
repository secret `FORK_SYNC_TOKEN`. Renew it when it expires (the sync run fails with a clear error).

When the sync PR is open:

1. Wait for **Upstream CI** and **Fork CI**. A failing `hooks` check means upstream moved code a hook lived in: re-apply
   the hook and update its FORK.md row.
2. Disable any **new upstream workflow** (FORK.md > Upstream workflows).
3. Merge with **Create a merge commit**, never squash or rebase: that keeps upstream's history, so the next merge only
   brings new commits.

On conflicts the run fails and its summary lists the files and the commands to resolve them locally.
